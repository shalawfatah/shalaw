👋 I'm Shalaw, a web developer focusing on frontend & tea. 
I'm a passionate self-taught web developer with years of experience, 
focusing on the frontend, especially Javascript & React. 
Unlike the stereotype, I do not want to write "beautiful code", 
I rather want to work with people on creative and innovative 
projects. It does not matter how we get it through, it's 
important that we ship functional and and user-friendly products 
that benefit people.
